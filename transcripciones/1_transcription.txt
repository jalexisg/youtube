I'm a millionaire, of course I don't drive a Lambo to impress others. I'm a millionaire, of course I fly economy to save money on flights. I'm a millionaire, of course I don't upgrade my phone every year to flex. I'm a millionaire, of course I dress the comfort, not validation. I'm a millionaire, of course I post about it online to inspire others.
