Would you recommend investing in oil then? Is that something that you personally invest in? Let me just say it again, you know, I used to be on CNBC. But I say I don't invest in anything they can print. I don't invest in this, stocks, bonds, ETFs. I'm an entrepreneur, I start gold mines, I start oil wells. I invest in cattle, you know, white-goo cattle, you know why? Because every time the cattle print I get cash flow.
