If a traffic camera catches you J-walking in China, digital ID system has you, has your blood now, has your genetic code, has your photograph, it can identify how you walk. So even if you can't see a face, you can be picked up by gate. It will convict you of J-walking and take money out of your bank account with no intermediating Jewish judiciary at all and show a picture of you to the people in the neighborhood so they know that you have J-walked and reduce your social credit score. And if your social credit score falls below a certain level, then you can't buy drinks from a vending machine, can't play video games, you can't go on a train, you can't get out of your 15-minute city. Oh, that's already in place in China.",
