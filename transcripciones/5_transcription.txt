The Bible says, a good man leads an inheritance to his children's children. The same Bible that says that says, House and riches are the inheritance of fathers and approving lifeless women. So according to the scripture, if I want to stand before God and present myself as a man who's good, not good for the purpose of getting into heaven, Jesus did that part. But somebody who is faithful to do the things he put me on this earth to do, one of the things I've got to do is provide house and riches for my children and my children's children. Like, he'd just say, give him $20,000 to get started. No, no, house and riches. You know what that means? This whole idea, you're 18, get out of my house and go figure it out. That's a Western American idea, it's not a biblical idea. Isaac lived with his father until he was 40 and he got married.
