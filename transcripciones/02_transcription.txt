Do you think Elon Musk has work-life balance? No. Do you think Steve Jobs, when he was alive, had work-life balance? No. Do you think Bill Gates? No. Henry Ford? No. Original Heineken? No. So, none of those people that created the wealth of the world had work-life balance. Why do you think you're going to have it? Because you deserve it? I don't think so. You deserve what you get in life by working hard.
